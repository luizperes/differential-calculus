$f(x) = ?$\\\\
We know that quadratic functions can be described as $y = a(x + h)^2 + k$ because 6 is the root, thus:
$y = a(x - 6)^2 + k = 0$ when $x = 6 \therefore k = 0$.
Now, we just need to substitute $y$ and $x$ with the point given $(7,2)$:\\
$f(x) = y$\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    y & = a(x - 6)^2 + 0\\
    2 & = a(7 - 6)^2\\
    a & = 2\\
    & \therefore\\
    f(x) & = 2(x - 6)^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$g(x) = ?$\\\\
The formula for quadratic functions is $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, thus:\\
First we will find $c$ by switching it with the given point $(0, 1)$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    1 & = a\times0 + b\times0 + c\\
    c & = 1 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Now we must substitute them with the other two given points $(-4, 11)$ and $(1, -6.5)$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    11 & = a(-4)^2 + -4b + 1 \textit{, c=1 as per (2)}\\
    & \therefore\\
    10 & = 16a - 4b
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    -6.5 & = a(1)^2 + 1b + 1 \textit{, c=1 as per (2)}\\
    & \therefore\\
    -7.5 & = a + b
\end{split}
\end{equation}
To find $a$ and $b$ now, we will need to eliminate one of them:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    10 & = 16a - 4b\\
    & + \\
    -7.5 & = a + b \textit{ we will eliminate b $\therefore$}\\
    -7.5\times(4) & = (a + b)\times(4)\\\\
    & \therefore\\
    10 & = 16a - 4b\\
    & (+)\\
    - 30 & = 4a + 4b\\\\
    10 + (-30) & = 16a + 4a - 4b + 4b\\
    -20 & = 20a\\
    a & = -1
\end{split}
\end{equation}
And now, we find $b$ with $a=1$ and $c=1$ by replacing with any of these points. I will take $(1, -6.5)$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	-6.5 & = -1(1)^2 + b(1) + 1\\
	-6.5 = b
\end{split}
\end{equation}
With that $g(x) = -(x)^2 + (-6.5)x + 1$.

2. Many physical quantities are connected by inverse square laws, that is, by power functions of the form 
$f(x) = kx^{-2}$.
 In particular, the illumination of an object by a light source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Suppose that after dark you are in a room with just one lamp and you are trying to read a book. The light is too dim and so you move halfway to the lamp. How much brighter is the light?\\\\
The equation is something like $\frac{1}{d^2}$, which satisfies $f(x) = kx^{-2}$, once $\frac{1}{d^2} = 1\times\textit{distance}^{-2}$, thus:\\\\
If you move halfway, we have something like:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    f(x) & = \frac{1}{d^{-2}} \textit{, distance = $\frac{1}{2}$}\\
    & = \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{2})^{-2}}\\
    & = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}}\\
    & = \frac{1}{1} \div \frac{1}{4}\\
    & = 4
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\\\\
3. Find an expression for a cubic function $f$ if $f(5) = 200$ and 
$f(âˆ’5) = f(0) = f(6) = 0$.
\\\\
$f(x) = ?$\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    y & = a (x+5)(x-6)(x)\\
    200 & = a (10)(-1)(5)\\
    200 & = -50a\\
    a & = -4\\
    & \therefore\\
    f(x) & = -4x(x+5)(x-6)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
